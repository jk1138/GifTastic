# GifTastic
Assignment from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp week 6: In this assignment,  you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

You can play around with this online at https://jk1138.github.io/GifTastic/.

Please click on the word buttons to get 10 gifs related to that emotion. In order to get a gif to move please click on the image and it will begin to move but once you would like the image to stop rendering please hit the iage again and it will stop.
